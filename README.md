## SQL Banking Project

In this project, I developed a relational database to manage customer accounts and track transactions. The database consists of three key tables:

// Customer: Stores essential customer details such as username, email, and associated account ID.
// Account: Holds account-related information, including account type, balance, and the linked customer.
// Transaction: Tracks all financial transactions (deposits/withdrawals) with details like amount and transaction date.
I populated the tables with sample data and wrote SQL queries to perform various tasks, including:

Calculating account balances.
Identifying accounts with the highest balances.
Retrieving transactions from the past.
This project provided hands-on experience in database design, data insertion, and SQL query writing for efficient data analysis.
