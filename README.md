# SQLBanking-Project

In this project, I created a database to manage customer accounts and transactions. The project involved three main tables:

Customer: Stores customer details (username, email, account ID).
Account: Holds account information (account type, balance, and linked customer).
Transaction: Tracks financial transactions (deposit/withdrawal, amount, date).
I inserted sample data into the tables and wrote SQL queries to perform tasks such as:

Calculating account balances.
Finding accounts with the highest balances.
Retrieving transactions from the last 30 days.
The project helped me learn how to design a database, insert data, and run SQL queries for data analysis.
